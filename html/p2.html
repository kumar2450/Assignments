 <h2> i tag(italic tag)  </h2>
 <p>The HTML i element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason. 
   Some examples include technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. 
   It is typically displayed in italic type.</p>
   <p>example:</p>
   <i>HyperTextMarkupLanguage</i>
   <p></p>
   <i>Css</i>
   <p></p>
   <i>Javascript</i>
   <br>
  <h2>b tag(bold tag)</h2>
  <p>The HTML Bring Attention To element (b) is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.
    and it is shows in boldface
  </p>
  <p> example:</p>
 
  <b>krishna</b>
  <br>
  <b>k</b>rishna
  <br>
  kri<b>s</b>hna
  <br>
  <h2>u tag(underline tag)</h2>
  <p>The u tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline. You can change this with CSS (see example below). 

    <p><b>Tip:</b>  Avoid using the  element where it could be confused for a hyperlink!</p>
  </p>
  <p>example:</p>
  <u>strong</u>
  <br>
  iron<u>man</u>
  <br>
  <h2>select tag</h2>
  <p>The select element is used to create a drop-down list.

    The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.
    
    <p> The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).</p>
    
   <p> The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.</p>
    
    <p>The option tags inside the select element define the available options in the drop-down list. </p>
    
    <b> Tip:</b>
    Always add the label tag for best accessibility practices!</p>
<br>
<h2>button tag</h2>
<p>The button tag defines a clickable button.</p>

  <p> Inside a button element you can put text (and tags like i,b, strong, br, img, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the input element!</p>
  
 <b>Tip:</b>  Always specify the type attribute for a button element, to tell browsers what type of button it is.</p>
